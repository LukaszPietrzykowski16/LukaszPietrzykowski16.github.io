My portfolio website to showcase my work. This website will be update in the future. 

## Technology
This website was built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (i used GSAP animation library and three.js beacuse in previopuse version of a site, there was 3D element instead of svg (i had a certain problems with it, so i decided to change a panel))
